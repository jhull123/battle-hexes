# How to Play Battle Hexes

Battle Hexes is a turn-based strategy game played on a hexagonal grid.
Players take turns moving their units across the board and engaging in combat.

## Movement and Combat

Units have a limited number of movement points each turn. They may move to any
adjacent hex, spending one movement point per hex. Movement stops immediately
when a unit enters a hex that is adjacent to an enemy unit. A unit may not move
again until combat around that hex is resolved.

This rule means that movement plans cannot pass through hexes that border enemy
units. If a path would cause a unit to become adjacent to an opponent, the unit
must end its movement on that hex.

## Ending the Game

Play continues until only one player still has units on the board. When all of
your opponents' forces have been eliminated, the game ends immediately.
